'''
REMARKS :-

    1. THE SOLUTION OF QUESTION 4 IS WRONG AS THE QUESTION SUGGESTS THAT YOU HAVE TO
    SOLVE THE ELECTRICITY BILL USING CONDITIONAL SALBS AS RATES VARY WITH UNITS 

    2. FOR QUESTION NUMBER 5 THE CODE DOES LOOK CORRECT BUT FOR TEST CASES LIKE 1900 
    IT FAILS AS THE PROGRAM OUTPUTS 1900 AS LEAP YEAR BUT EXPECTED OUTPUT IS NOT A LEAP YEAR

    3. TRY WORKING ON THE LOGIC AND THINK OF THEM FROM STRONG CORNER CASES IN ORDER TO 
    AVOID ERROR AND MISTAKES

FINAL SCORE :- 8 / 10
